Suggested Workflow Steps

1. Clone the project and checkout to development branch
    - git clone https://github.com/jennifer-ruan/checkout-price.git
    - git checkout development

2. Create a branch to push your own changes to (preferably with your own name)
    - git checkout -b [your branch name]

3. Perform manual tests (see ./src/Tests.txt) before you push your changes

4. Push your changes to your own branch
    - git checkout [your branch name]
    - git push --set-upstream origin [your branch name]

5. Create a pull request on GitHub (make sure that you're trying to merge your branch with the development branch, not master)
